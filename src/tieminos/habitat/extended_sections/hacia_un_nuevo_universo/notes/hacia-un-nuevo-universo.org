* TODO Clarify threshold levels for Milo and have a strategy for setting them on different scenarios
* TODO investigar 2.2.12
* TODO Micro 1 EQ boost lows on second and third section
** TODO Also increase transposition probability to low notes on that section
* TODO Gong, third section lows in third section at the bottom
* TODO Gong subbass throughout
* TODO Ajustar width del paneo, incrementarlo
* 2.2.30 - constellation tests
** TODO in general fix the balance between the clean and processed outputs of the guitar. Processed seems too low, but then the clean output may need to be reduced a little bit.
** TODO Remove UAD plugins in Mics 2 and 3 to reduce latency
** part 2
*** TODO In this part the guitar needs to be fed at a higher volume to the process, as it can barely be heard in there and is fully masked by the clean output
*** #5 works great
*** #3
*** #4
*** #6
* 2.2.28
*Added harmonic constellations*
Adds controls for switching harmonies and controls for playing samples
Also work on panning
** IDEA Nueva idea para el final
SCHEDULED: <2024-05-22 Wed>
Gong de Milo: encontrar fundamental/bajo, darle un boost con eq, y panearlo en círculos (quizá a la vez clock/counterclock), que tenga su propia interacción con la una o varias constelaciones y la guitarra
*** IDEA Micro del gong puede tener una sola constelación y los otros tener distintas e ir mutando
SCHEDULED: <2024-05-29 Wed>
** Técnica de guitarra para la tercera parte:
- Resonadores entre 1 y 2da pastilla.
- Selector de pastillas (1era y 3era, y solo 3era).
- Slide del lado izquierdo, arco del lado derecho.
- Amp: Tone+Boost, Vol ~8, Bass ~8, Mid ~3.5, Treble ~3.5
** Revisar panneo2 rápido

*** Changes
**** Improved levels
I think master level increased although not sure as there's no record of it on the previous rehearsal
**** Changes in EQ of mics
Removed unnecessary band (notchy) cuts
**** Improved use of upwards compression on mics
- Elevated wet level
- Reduced threshold
- Increased ratio to almost infinity.

* 2.2.26
** Added reverb to the guitar
** YES Post-rehearsal reworked on `ps-ringz` synth

*** Percu processes at higher volume and clean guitar is lower
** Added a reverb with side-chain ducking so that when the Percu/Processes track is silent the reverb can substitute
